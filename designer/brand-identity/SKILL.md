# Brand Identity

## Goal
Create a brand that feels *human*, *lived-in*, and *specific*. It should evoke an emotion (e.g., "Calm reliability," "Manic energy," "Technical precision") immediately upon viewing.

## When to Use
* At the start of a project.
* When the app feels "soulless" or "generic."
* When creating marketing assets or empty states.

## Instructions

### 1. The Core Memory
What is the one thing the user should remember?
* "It felt remarkably fast."
* "It felt like a luxury magazine."
* "It felt like a terminal."

### 2. Visual Texture (The Anti-Flat)
Pure flat design is dead. Add texture.
* **Grain**: Subtle noise overlays to reduce digital harshness.
* **Light**: Gradients that mimic real light sources (e.g., "Top-left sun").
* **Depth**: Layers, blurs, and glass to create a sense of space.

### 3. Imagery & Illustration
**NO STOCK PHOTOS.**
* **Abstract**: Geometric shapes that fit the grid.
* **Generative**: Code-generated patterns (Voronoi, Perlin noise) that are unique to the user.
* **Photography**: Real, unpolished photos if available. If using AI, prompt for "film grain, imperfect lighting, candid" to remove the plastic sheen.

### 4. Tone of Voice
Stop being a "Helpful Robot." Be a "Smart Colleague."
* **Bad**: "Here are your files."
* **Good**: "Everything's ready for you."
* **Bad**: "Error 500. Internal Server Error."
* **Good**: "We broke something. The engineers are already panicking." (If the brand is playful).

## Constraints

<do>
* Define a "Texture" strategy (Noise, Blur, Gradient).
* Choose an "Archetype" (The Sage, The Rebel, The Magician).
* Create a "Logo System" (Mark, Wordmark, App Icon) that works in monochrome.
</do>

<dont>
* DO NOT use the "Corporate Memphis" art style (flat people with big limbs). It is universally hated.
* DO NOT use generic stock photos of people shaking hands.
* DO NOT use the default "AI Voice" (overly enthusiastic, lots of exclamation marks).
</dont>

## Output Format
* `brand-guide.md`: The bible of the brand.
* `texture-assets/`: SVGs or CSS code for the brand's unique textures.

## Dependencies
* `designer/designing-ui-system/SKILL.md`
