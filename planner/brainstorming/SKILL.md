# Brainstorming

## Goal
Generate a wide range of potential solutions or ideas for a specific problem, then filter and refine them into the best approach.

## When to Use
* When stuck on a hard technical or product problem.
* When defining the features of a new application.
* When the "standard way" doesn't seem to fit.
* When looking for a "wow" factor or differentiator.

## Instructions

### 1. Divergent Phase (Quantity over Quality)
List as many ideas as possible without judgment.
* **"Yes, and..."**: Build on previous ideas.
* **Inversion**: "How would we make this terrible?" then flip it.
* **Analogy**: "How does [Uber/Spotify/NASA] solve this?"
* **Constraint Removal**: "What if we had infinite compute? What if we had 0 latency?"

### 2. Categorization
Group ideas into themes.
* **Safe/Incremental**: Low risk, standard implementations.
* **Bold/Risky**: High effort, potentially high reward.
* **Blue Sky**: Requires new tech or massive resources.

### 3. Convergent Phase (Selection)
Filter ideas based on:
* **Feasibility**: Can we build this in the given time?
* **Impact**: Does this solve the user's problem 10x better?
* **Alignment**: Does this fit the brand and goals?

### 4. The "Steelman"
Take the chosen idea and try to break it. "Why will this fail?"
If it survives the critique, it's ready for planning.

## Constraints

<do>
* Encourage wild ideas during the divergent phase.
* Document the rejected ideas (and why) to avoid re-hashing them later.
* Focus on the user's perspective.
* Use analogies to explain complex concepts.
</do>

<dont>
* DO NOT criticize ideas during the generation phase.
* DO NOT settle for the first solution that comes to mind.
* DO NOT let technical constraints kill an idea too early (unless it's physically impossible).
</dont>

## Output Format
* `brainstorming_session.md`: A record of ideas, categories, and the final decision.
* Updates to project requirements or specs.

## Dependencies
* `planner/project-planning/SKILL.md`
