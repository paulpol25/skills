# Project Planning

## Goal
Transform a high-level goal or vague idea into a structured, actionable roadmap with clear milestones, defined MVP scope, and identified risks.

## When to Use
* At the start of a new project.
* When a project's scope is creeping or undefined.
* When needing to prioritize features for an MVP.

## Instructions

### 1. Define the North Star
Identify the core value proposition.
* **Problem**: What specific pain point are we solving?
* **Solution**: How do we solve it better than alternatives?
* **Audience**: Who exactly is this for?

### 2. Establish the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Ruthlessly cut features to the absolute minimum required to solve the core problem.
* **Must Have**: Non-negotiable features.
* **Should Have**: Important but can wait for v1.1.
* **Could Have**: Nice to have.
* **Won't Have**: Explicitly out of scope for now.

### 3. Phases and Milestones
Break the timeline into logical chunks.

* **Phase 1: Foundation** (Scaffolding, Auth, DB schema)
* **Phase 2: Core Loop** (The main feature user interacts with)
* **Phase 3: Polish** (UI cleanup, error handling, onboarding)
* **Phase 4: Launch** (Deployment, smoke testing)

### 4. Risk Assessment
Identify what could go wrong.
* **Technical Risks**: "We don't know how to use this API."
* **Product Risks**: "Users might not understand the workflow."
* **Mitigation**: "Build a prototype first" or "Add tooltips."

## Constraints

<do>
* Prioritize "Core Loop" features over administrative features (like "Edit Profile") in the MVP.
* Define "Done" criteria for each milestone.
* Focus on user outcomes, not just technical tasks.
* keep the MVP timeline under 4 weeks if possible.
</do>

<dont>
* DO NOT plan more than one phase ahead in detail. Things change.
* DO NOT allow "scope creep" without removing something else of equal size.
* DO NOT skip the "Why". Every feature must map back to the North Star.
</dont>

## Output Format
* `roadmap.md`: A high-level timeline of phases.
* Updates to `tasks.md` (high-level epics).

## Dependencies
* `architect/analyzing-requirements/SKILL.md`
