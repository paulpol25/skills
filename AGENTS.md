# AGENTS.md — AI Agent Skills Orchestration

This file defines the 8 agent roles, their responsibilities, and the skills available to each. Every agent reads this file to understand the team structure and delegation boundaries.

## How This System Works

1. **Agent Manager** decomposes user requirements into tasks in `tasks.md`
2. Each task is assigned to a specialist agent based on skills below
3. Agents execute tasks using their SKILL.md files as instructions
4. All agents share skills in `shared/` for cross-cutting concerns
5. Agent Manager reviews output and coordinates handoffs

## Shared Skills (All Agents)

|-------|------|---------|
| Task Tracking | `shared/task-tracking/SKILL.md` | Read/write tasks.md, follow task format |
| Git Workflow | `shared/git-workflow/SKILL.md` | Branching, commits, pull requests |
| Environment Config | `shared/environment-config/SKILL.md` | Env vars, secrets, config files |
| Code Review | `shared/code-review/SKILL.md` | Review standards, checklist, feedback |
