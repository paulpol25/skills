# Skill Title (Title Case)

## Goal
One sentence describing what success looks like when this skill is applied correctly.

## When to Use
* Bullet list of specific triggers, contexts, or conditions
* When [specific situation] requires [specific action]
* After [prerequisite] is complete and [condition] is met

## Instructions

### Step 1: Title
Explanation of what to do and why.

```language
// Code example demonstrating the step
```

### Step 2: Title
Explanation of what to do and why.

```language
// Code example demonstrating the step
```

### Step 3: Title
Explanation of what to do and why.

## Constraints

<do>
* Explicit best practice 1
* Explicit best practice 2
* Explicit best practice 3
</do>

<dont>
* Explicit anti-pattern 1 — why it's bad
* Explicit anti-pattern 2 — why it's bad
* Explicit anti-pattern 3 — why it's bad
</dont>

## Output Format
Describe what the agent should produce: file(s), structure, format, naming.

## Dependencies
* `relative/path/to/prerequisite/SKILL.md` — why it's needed
* `relative/path/to/another/SKILL.md` — why it's needed
```

---

## Guidelines

* **Target 80-140 lines** per SKILL.md — be concise but complete
* **Max 150 lines** — move reference material to `references/` subdirectory
* **Use real code examples** — not pseudocode, not placeholders
* **3-6 constraints** in each `<do>` and `<dont>` block
* **Link dependencies by relative path** from the skill file's location
* **Gerund naming** for the parent directory (e.g., `building-components/SKILL.md`)
