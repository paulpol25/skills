## Field Guidelines

### Status
* **Todo**: Not started, requirements are clear
* **In Progress**: Agent is actively working on this task
* **Done**: All acceptance criteria met, output reviewed
* **Blocked**: Cannot proceed — document the blocker in Notes

### Difficulty
* **Easy**: Single file change, well-defined scope, < 30 min
* **Medium**: Multiple files, some design decisions, 30 min - 2 hours
* **Hard**: Cross-agent coordination, architectural decisions, 2+ hours
* **Critical**: Blocking other work, security-sensitive, or production-impacting

### Task IDs
* Sequential integers: TASK-001, TASK-002, etc.
* Never reuse a task ID, even if the task is deleted
* Reference other tasks by ID in Dependencies and Notes

### Imperative Mood
Write task titles as commands:
* "Implement user registration endpoint" (correct)
* "User registration endpoint" (incorrect — not imperative)
* "Implemented user registration endpoint" (incorrect — past tense)
